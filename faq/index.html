                                We pay close attention to forecast weather and there is enough flexibility built into the training plan to work around most weather challenges.  Lectures and flights can be moved to accommodate most weather events.  In the case that you cannot take your checkride on the scheduled day, arrangements can be made to either try the next day, or in a worst case scenario, you will have to return at a future date.  Unfortunately, weather is one thing we cannot control.
